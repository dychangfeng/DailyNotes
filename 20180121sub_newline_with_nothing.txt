how to remove the new line at the end of fasta file:
Method 1:
  awk '$1=$1' ORS='' chr22.fa
Method 2:

  sed -i ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/\t/g' file

Breakdown:
; (semicolon is just a command separator within sed)
sed (The command that calls the sed program)
:a (a marker which we use to iterate over and over)
N (Appends the next line to the pattern space)
$!ba (repeats the N command for all lines but the last line)
s/\n/\t/g (replaces all occurences of the newline character with tab)
