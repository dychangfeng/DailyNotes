Example 5: Commify the simple number.

Let us create file called numbers which has list of numbers. The below sed command example is used to commify the numbers till thousands.

$ cat  numbers
1234
12121
3434
123

$sed 's/\(^\|[^0-9.]\)\([0-9]\+\)\([0-9]\{3\}\)/\1\2,\3/g' numbers
1,234
12,121
3,434
123
The command below matches words starting with any character, followed by the letter ‘o’, followed by the same character as the first.
sed -E -n '/^(.)o\1$/p' /usr/share/dict/words
bob
mom
non
pop
sos
tot
wow
This command searches for 6-letter palindromes (the first three letters are 3 subexpressions, followed by 3 back-references in reverse order):

$ sed -E -n '/^(.)(.)(.)\3\2\1$/p' /usr/share/dict/words
