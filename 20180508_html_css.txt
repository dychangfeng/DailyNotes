We assign all HTML elements attributes by including property/value pairs in the opening tag:
     <tagname property = "value"></tagname>
     <a href="http://d3js.org/">The D3 website</a>
     <p class="uplifting awesome">Awe-inspiring paragraph</p> : this class is both uplifting AND awesome

Class and ID names can NOT begin with numbers. They must begin with alphabetic characters.
